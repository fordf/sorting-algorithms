### Insertion Sort
For each element in the given list, compare it's value to the previous elements one
at a time. If the current element is smaller than the previous element, swap them,
and compare against the new previous element. Once the previous element is smaller
than the current element, continue on to the next unsorted element.

Time Complexity: O(n<sup>2</sup>)
